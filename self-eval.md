# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
**_RESPONSE:_** I tried to be as considerate to including everything I learned from the assignment, but there was just one thing in the Hobbit challenge that I couldn't really get. not upset, but hoping I can come back to it and solve it. I feel good about it all, though!

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
**_RESPONSE:_** It went well! I actually decided to take a nap before fully finishing and I'm glad that I honored my body by listening to it. I came back with a clear mind and the results are awesome.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
**_RESPONSE:_**  I feel like I'll need some
